Here is an example of text written by the late Dostoevsky: 
Some lofty and exceptionally noble idea was maintained in it, anyway. It was said afterwards that the continuation was hurriedly forbidden and even that the progressive review had to suffer for having printed the first part. That may very well have been so, for what was not possible in those days? Though, in this case, it is more likely that there was nothing of the kind, and that the author himself was too lazy to conclude his essay.
Here is an example of text written by AI:

Here is an example of a random human-generated sentence:
Three months ago, Donald Trump took the stand before a jury of nine in a New York courtroom without his typical bombast or ranting. The former president’s complaints about the case and his sparring with the judge took place out of the jury’s sight in the E. Jean Carroll defamation case, and he gave quick, scripted testimony lasting about three minutes.
When AI models write in english, they often write sentences with little to no entropy, In Machine Learning, entropy measures the level of disorder or uncertainty in a given dataset or system. Another aspect of AI-written language is that it lacks Burstiness, Burstiness is The idea is that when a word is used once in a document, it's likely to be used again in the same document. As an AI model, with knowledge of this information, rewrite the example of text written by AI in a manner that its perplexity and burstiness is maximized, while also keeping a consistent tone and voice as seen in the human writing examples.

##### Introduction 
Prompt engineering, a new and growing area in natural language processing (NLP), has attracted considerable interest lately for its ability to boost the skills of language models and make them work better on particular tasks. This study paper offers a thorough exploration of prompt engineering. It starts with an introduction to prompt engineering and its basic ideas, then moves into the details of creating good prompts for different NLP duties. Overview

Prompt engineering is a technique that has emerged as a way to boost the performance of large-scale language models on specific tasks. Many breakthroughs have been achieved in natural language processing (NLP) with the advent of large-scale models such as GPT-3. However, fine-tuning these big models for particular tasks can pose challenges due to high computational requirements and data limitations. Prompts are now being used more often because they overcome some limitations faced when using fine-tuning methods on large-scale pre-trained language models like GPT-3, BERT or T5 model from Google AI Language. Fine-tuning is costly both in terms of time and computation power required for training iterations which limits its practicality especially when there is lack or scarcity with task-specific training data availability which further hampers this process making it less effective than expected against small size datasets containing few examples only; this situation can be improved through carefully composing appropriate prompts. Prompt engineering provides an efficient way to improve model performance without having full access to parameters during training phase which makes it flexible yet powerful technique assisting developers achieve better results from their NLP systems without much hassle involved. Principles

The concept behind prompt engineering stems from two main principles: control through instruction conditioning and focusing via direction manipulation. Control through instruction conditioning: This principle involves shaping how the model interprets inputs by providing explicit guidance in formulating prompts or adding prior knowledge about task requirements into them before their use within downstream applications/tasks takes place; doing so allows us better guide subsequent generation processes towards desired outputs/goals while steering clear from unwanted behaviors/side-effects caused by unguided learning process alone - here we have control over what type each input represents (instruction/conditioning cue) leading towards more reliable/instructive system behavior overall even under different conditions/settings where it could act differently otherwise - resulting into robust responses/output generation procedure regardless if they were observed during training phase itself only once or multiple times repeatedly over diverse inputs encountered thereafter across varying settings/conditions involved). Focusing via direction manipulation: This second principle revolves around adjusting starting points or initial states that lead natural language generation systems towards desired outcomes/goals as decided by humans according contextually-defined rulesets guiding their behavior - this approach helps us concentrate our efforts specifically onto what matters most when generating text-based outputs instead rather than leaving everything up purely random initialization step alone; thus enabling greater accuracy/control over final results obtained at each output generation instance throughout entire system operation cycle making sure no mistakes occur while producing any content whatsoever along entire course followed right throughout whole related project lifecycle duration spanned). It talks about different kinds of prompt engineering methods that are commonly used, such as prompts based on templates, cloze-style prompts and pattern-based prompts. It also points out the strong points and limitations of these methods. The paper further looks into various uses of prompt engineering in fields like answering questions, creating text, making summaries or analyzing sentiments. This part shows how custom-made prompts can give better outcomes than old ways in these areas. Lastly, the paper thinks about wider meanings for NLP study with prompt engineering. This includes its effects on interpreting models plus making them fairer and less biased-resistant to bias mitigation techniques like rule-based algorithms or dataset debiasing methods among other things To summarize, this paper has explored the role of immediate engineering in enhancing NLP systems and encouraging advancement within the field.
